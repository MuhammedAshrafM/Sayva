 *   picks concrete behavior from the adapter IDs below.
 * @param runtimeType Registry key into `ModelRuntimeRegistry` — e.g.
 *   `tflite`, `coreml`, `onnx`.
 * @param inferenceStrategy Registry key describing how frames are fed to
 *   the model (`single_frame`, `sliding_window`, `streaming_stateful`).
 *   Phase 1 uses `single_frame` for every model.
 * @param confidenceThresholds Per-model UI bucketing. Different architectures
